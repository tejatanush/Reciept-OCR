# Reciept-OCR
Character Extraction Model makes it easy for users to extract text, such as prices, dates, and item names, from printed or digital receipts. This model uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) powered by computer vision to automatically read and convert printed text on receipts into editable and searchable digital formats. It eliminates the need for manual data entry, making it a great tool for expense tracking, financial management, and business reporting.

### Applications
* OCR is widely used in automating expense reporting and accounting by extracting information from receipts, invoices, and bills.
* OCR is used to convert scanned paper documents, such as receipts, contracts, and tax forms, into searchable and editable digital files for better document management.
* OCR is used to scan receipts and invoices for verifying product purchases, returns, and warranty claims.
*  ### Compiler Type:  
I used a compiler CPU provided in google colab while running this project.
